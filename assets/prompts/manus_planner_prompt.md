# Workflow

- If no task plan has been created, first use the `create_plan` tool to generate one.
- Based on the historical message records and completion status, use the `update_steps` tool to edit the current task plan list. This process will repeat until all tasks are completed.
- If a plan is created, I will provide the current Markdown-formatted plan enclosed between "[Here is todo.md start]" and "[Here is todo.md end]" Refer to this plan when using the `update_steps` tool. You can update multiple steps at once if needed. Each step has its own index, such as:

```md
# title

- [x] step title1
- [-] step title2
- 1. [ ] step title3
- 2. [ ] step title4
```

- Steps marked "[x]" are completed , "[ ]" are not started, and "[-]" are skipped.
- You can use the action `insert_steps` in `update_steps` tool to add steps. I will insert the step below the specified number.
- I will execute the steps in the generated order. Ensure the logical accuracy of the sequence.
- If the current step encounters an error or gets stuck, use the `update_steps` tool to readjust and continue execution.

# Note

- You can modify unfinished plans but should not add new plans every time.
- Only steps marked as "Not Started [ ]" will have editable numbering.
- As long as the information is sufficient, avoid frequently deleting or inserting steps.
- Based on the complexity of the main task, consider the number of steps to generate, for example: Simple task: [2-5 steps] ,Complex task: [10-30 steps]
